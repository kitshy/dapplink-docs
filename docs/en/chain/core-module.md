# Functional Modules

##

DappLink, as a modular blockchain middleware, is dedicated to simplifying the deployment and operation of Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks, while promoting the advancement of chain abstraction technology. Through innovations like Rollup abstraction, cross-chain abstraction, L2 multi-staking protocols, proof system abstraction, fast verification network abstraction, and modular Layer 3 solutions, DappLink provides developers with efficient and flexible foundational components.

- Rollup Abstraction: DappLink supports both transaction data Rollups and transaction proof Rollups, and is compatible with multiple Data Availability (DA) solutions including EIP-4844, EigenDA, Celestia, NearDA, and AnyTrust, allowing developers to choose the optimal solution based on their needs. Furthermore, its Rollup proof system supports both fraud proofs (for Optimistic Rollups) and validity proofs (for ZK Rollups), ensuring transaction security and verifiability.

- Cross-chain Abstraction: DappLink enables a decentralized cross-chain bridge, supporting asset and message transfers between any chains. It utilizes a decentralized relayer network that leverages MPC verification and ZK transaction proofs to ensure cross-chain transactions are secure, censorship-resistant, and efficient. Additionally, a liquidity pool (FundingPool) manages cross-chain capital flows, allowing LPs to participate in staking and rewards distribution.

- L2 Multi-staking Protocol: DappLink offers a BTC- and ETH-equivalent secure staking model, enabling users to restake via EigenLayer and earn multiple yields. The CCIP module synchronizes staking information between Layer 1 and Layer 2, ensuring transparency and enforcement of reward and slashing mechanisms.

- Fast Verification Network: DappLink builds a fast-finality verification network using Babylon and Symbiotic staking mechanisms, reducing the waiting time for fraud proofs, accelerating Layer 2 asset withdrawals, and significantly enhancing the user experience for L2 dApps.

- Modular Layer3 Solution: DappLink is designed with a composable Layer 3 framework, supporting Web3 application chains such as social, gaming, and custodial services, enabling upper-layer applications to rapidly integrate into the Web3 ecosystem.
