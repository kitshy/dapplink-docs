# DappLink Layer3

## 1. What is Layer3?

Layer3 is a decentralized application protocol chain (AppChain) built on top of Layer2. Its security is jointly ensured by the underlying Layer1 networks (such as Ethereum, Bitcoin) and Layer2 networks (like Arbitrum, OP, zkSync, etc.).

To maintain high availability, low complexity, and the “small yet powerful” design principle, Layer3 chains are typically optimized for a single application scenario, such as:

- Decentralized social and gaming (focus on data interaction and high-frequency operations)
- Decentralized custody systems (focus on security and private key management)
- Decentralized trading protocols (focus on high throughput and asset settlement)

By isolating complex scenarios into dedicated Layer3 chains, developers can simplify system architecture, while also improving performance and security.


## 2. Why Choose DappLink’s General-Purpose Layer3?

With the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, sectors such as social, gaming, custody, and trading are becoming large-scale and application-specific. As a result, Layer3 AppChains are emerging as a key infrastructure for the next generation of Web3.

Major Layer2 projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are already laying out Layer3 strategies.

In response to this trend, DappLink has introduced specialized Layer3 protocols including:

- Social + Gaming Layer3 AppChain
- Custody-focused Layer3 AppChain
- Trading-oriented Layer3 AppChain

###### DappLink also introduces a “General-Purpose Layer3 Infrastructure” concept:

This infrastructure can be deployed on any Layer2, enabling developers to rapidly build Layer3 AppChains tailored to specific verticals. This significantly improves compatibility, flexibility, and the success rate of Web3 projects.

In other words, whether you’re building on Arbitrum, OP, zkSync, or others — with DappLink’s Layer3 protocol, you can launch your own Layer3 AppChain with one click.
