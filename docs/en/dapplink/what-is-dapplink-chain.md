# What is One-Click Chain Deployment?

As Web3 infrastructure evolves rapidly, launching a dedicated Layer2 or Layer3 public chain is becoming a strategic imperative for many blockchain projects. However, the traditional process of building a chain often involves complex technology stacks and highly customized workflows.

To solve this challenge, DappLink introduces its One-Click Chain Deployment solution. By leveraging a modular middleware architecture, DappLink greatly simplifies the entire process—from chain design and deployment to operation and optimization.

The goal of DappLink’s One-Click Chain Deployment is to empower developers to build customizable Layer2/Layer3 networks like assembling building blocks, equipped with essential capabilities such as cross-chain communication, data availability configuration, and security proof mechanisms.


## 1. DappLink Modular Public Chain Middleware Capabilities

- Rollup Abstraction
  - Supports both transaction data and transaction proof abstraction.
  - Seamlessly connects to any Layer2 or Layer3 network.
  - Compatible with various DA (Data Availability) layers such as AnyTrust, Celestia, EigenDA, EIP-4844, and NearDA, allowing developers to choose the most suitable DA solution for their use case.

- Cross-Chain Abstraction
  - Enables asset and message transfer from any chain to any chain.
  - Verified by a decentralized Relayer network composed of MPC (multi-signature) validators.
  - Uses Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-Proof) to secure cross-chain interactions.

- L2 Multi-Staking Protocol
  - Implements a secure staking model comparable to BTC and ETH.
  - Allows stakers to earn multiple rewards through a flexible staking framework.

- Proof System Abstraction：DappLink is building universal support for both Fraud Proofs and Validity Proofs:
  - Fraud Proofs: Designed for Optimistic Rollups (e.g., OP, Arbitrum), assuming that sequencers can behave maliciously. The proof system serves to detect and prevent malicious actions.
  - Validity Proofs: Tailored for ZK Rollups (e.g., Scroll, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, Linea), where every transaction is accompanied by a ZK proof generated off-chain and verified on-chain.
  - DappLink is currently developing: Fraud Proof abstractions for OP and Arbitrum, Validity Proof abstractions for Scroll, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and Linea

- Fast Finality Network Abstraction
  - Accelerates the finality of Rollup states and reduces the waiting time for fraud proof windows.
  - Enables fast Layer1 asset withdrawal and real-time Layer2 finality, significantly improving the Dapp user experience.

- Composable Layer3 Modules
  - Provides a modular architecture to build Layer3 chains tailored to specific business scenarios.
  - Already supports industry use cases such as social, gaming, and custody-focused Layer3 appchains.


## 2. Composable and Business-Oriented Layer3

Layer3 is a lightweight application-specific blockchain designed for particular business scenarios. DappLink offers a modular framework to support Layer3 construction with the following characteristics:

  - Enables business-driven architecture, where upper-layer logic defines the base-layer design.
  - Ideal for Web3 applications like social networks, games, asset custody, and trading.
  - Each Layer3 chain serves a single scenario, ensuring high availability, security, and performance.
  - Can be integrated with any Layer2 ecosystem, offering strong compatibility and deployment flexibility.

## 3. Success Stories

Since its launch, DappLink has successfully supported several Web3 chain abstraction initiatives:
- Manta: Leveraged DappLink’s fast finality network, enabling near-instant Layer2 block finalization and fast Layer1 withdrawals.
- HashRoot: Rapidly deployed a Layer3 PayFi-specific app chain using DappLink’s composable Layer3 solution.

DappLink’s One-Click Chain Deployment lowers the barrier to launching secure, scalable, and application-driven blockchains. Whether you’re building a custom Layer2 or a dedicated Layer3 AppChain, DappLink equips you with the tools and flexibility to bring your chain to life—faster, safer, and with full Web3 interoperability.
