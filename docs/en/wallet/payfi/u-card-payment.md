# Decentralized U-Card Payment
##

- U Card does not store private keys: Fully decentralized, offline signing, requiring the app to store the private key locally and provide offline signing functionality.
- U Card (Digital Currency Card) stores private keys: The U Card integrates a signing chip and storage, with the private key encrypted by a passphrase. The POS terminal constructs a 32-byte Message, which is transmitted to the U Card for signing via NFC. In this case, the U Card functions as a small hardware wallet.
