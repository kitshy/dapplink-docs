# Overview

##

With the rapid development of the Web3 ecosystem, digital asset management has become a crucial part of blockchain applications. Whether it is exchanges, centralized wallets, or decentralized MPC custody systems, all require efficient, secure, and scalable wallet infrastructure. The DappLink One-Click Wallet Deployment Platform is designed to address this demand, providing a one-click wallet deployment solution that supports the rapid integration and launch of centralized wallets, decentralized wallets, and custody systems.

Since the launch of the project, the DappLink One-Click Wallet Platform has already partnered with multiple project teams, including Parapack and FishCake, both of which have successfully integrated DappLinkâ€™s one-click wallet and launched it smoothly.

The DappLink One-Click Wallet Platform provides efficient and convenient wallet infrastructure for different types of Web3 projects and mainly supports the following application scenarios:

- Exchange Wallets: Supports deposit and withdrawal, aggregation, cold, warm, and hot wallet management processes.
- Centralized Wallets: Provides high-performance, multi-chain compatible wallet backend services.
- Decentralized Wallets: Supports hierarchical deterministic wallet architecture and secure decentralized key management.
- MPC Custody Systems: Based on MPC and ZK technologies, it enables decentralized private key management, MPC dynamic committee signing, enhancing security and compliance.

The platform adopts a modular design to ensure that each component can be deployed independently while also supporting one-click integration.
